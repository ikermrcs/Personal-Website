      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Iker and I am currently in my final year of Law, Business Administration and Finance, about to
        begin my professional career.
      </p>
      <p>My main interest lies in commodity trading, the backbone of the global economy. What fascinates me about this
        market is its fundamental role in driving production and consumption, its dynamic and volatile nature, and its
        constant evolution due to factors such as geopolitical events and sustainability trends. Navigating these
        complexities and contributing to the transformation of the industry is what truly excites me.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my qualities I consider these to be some of the main ones in me:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Critcal. I am able to analyse situations from various perspectives and in an objective manner, which allows
          me to make better decisions.</li>
        <li>Resolute. I remain calm in any situation, no matter how high the pressure may be, and I seek solutions to
          problems quickly and decisively.</li>
        <li>Creative. I look for original solutions, facing challenges in unusual ways, and I explore new ideas and
          approaches.</li>
        <li>Versatile. I adapt easily to any environment or situation, being able to take on different roles, and I have
          a facility for learning new concepts.s</li>
      </ul>

            <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2005</h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">In 2005 I was admitted to Sacred Heart Carmelite School, where I spent 15
              years of my life. During these years I was a member of the school's football team, I participated in
              numerous competitions such as the maths olympiads or writing competitions, and I also studied, in a
              complementary manner, professional music studies. In this same school I studied my baccalaureate in social
              sciences, beginning my preparation to access the double degree of Business Administration and Law.</p>

            <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2020</h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">Once I finished my baccalaureate studies, I was admitted to the University
              of Deusto to study a double degree in Business Administration and Law, being Deusto considered one of the
              best universities in Spain to study these degrees. I am currently in my 4th year focusing on my
              professional career which will start soon. </p>

            <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2021</h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">While studying at Deusto I realised that I had a great interest in
              finance; I was sure that in the future I would work in something related to it. Therefore, to perfect my
              knowledge acquired at Deusto and because of the strong interest I had in finance, I started an online
              degree through the University of La Rioja.</p>

            <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2022</h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">In 2022 I had the opportunity to spend the summer doing a course on
              financial risk analysis and management at the London School of Economics. It was undoubtedly one of the
              best experiences of my life: I developed my knowledge on a subject of great interest to me, such as
              options and futures, I met many people and made some incredible friends, and I enjoyed college life at one
              of the world's leading universities.</p>
